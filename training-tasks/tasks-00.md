# 训练任务

The two main goals of this year's intensive training are speech development and memory expansion. Another measure of success is dedicating at least three hours a day, totaling to a thousand hours in a year.

Don't fall into the trap of thinking the ultimate goal is merely making English your first language. What we accumulate and gain in this process is a comprehensive self-learning experience, which might be the first for many.

More than that, this self-learning experience will inevitably reshape one's perspective on education overall, influencing choices, and potentially altering the fate of an individual or even a family.

As an author, I can't confine myself to teaching English. Theoretically, we can use the same approach to learn anything, as long as we believe it's necessary.

In a certain sense, this is my one-man fight against the global education system for the sake of my children. From another perspective, it's a Quixotic story, a madman determined to tilt at windmills, come what may.
